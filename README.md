Dataannotations validation

We use Dataannotations for the validation of the models that we have
In fact, we can also use Fluent Validation
Depending on the application, it is very important to choose one of these two for the statistical validity of the models
This is how we evaluate the models that are filled by the user
There are other ways for validation and not only these two ways

user input checking facility at client side and provides to asp developer, a wide range of validator attributes. Data Annotation makes the validating process easy and quick.
Data Annotation attributes directly applies to Model class member and those members are bounded to accept valid user input according to Data Annotation Rule.

We Have Fluent Validation source code in this page 
you can see it too.
Thanks ❤
